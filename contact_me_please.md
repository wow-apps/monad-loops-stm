# Hi!

Hope you're fine!

I came to you with a question for a favior: I have my own small company Wildsoft LTD. and I want to move all my contributions under companies GitHub account.

So, of course I can make a GitHub organization id like `wildsoft-io` or similar, but you know, that in open source contribution it's not a good practice.

If this name is not so important for you, please contact me to discuss how can I get this name `wildsoft`.

Thank you for attention.
